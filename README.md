# Oracle Cloud Free Backup

This backup script is a form from  [Todd Sharp](https://blogs.oracle.com/authors/todd-sharp), but his script doesn't work anymore because Oracle changed the OCI API a bit.

This one is a working version.

It's supposed to run daily scheduled by a cronjob, connects to the OCI API and starts a server backup.
